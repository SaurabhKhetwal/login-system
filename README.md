> I create a project file loginproject
> In my login project i create one app loginapp
> Then I create three html page 1. signup.html 2. login.html 3. index.html
> In my signup page user can enter there (username, email adress, and password) then user can signup then user will 
  redirect to the login page then here user can login through their username and password and then user can redirect 
  home page(index.html).
